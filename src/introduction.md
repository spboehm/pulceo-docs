# Introduction

## Quickstart

What is PULCEO?

PULCEO stands for **P**latform for **U**niversal and **L**ightweight **C**loud-Edge **O**rchestration.
It tackles the challenge to realize latency- and location-aware placements of latency-critical applications in cloud, edge, and IoT environments.
PULCEO provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to allow every customer to deploy latency-critical applications, only by defining a small set of configuration parameters.
According to a the of configuration parameters, PULCEO places, offloads, onloads, and scales applications to a distributed infrastructure.
PULCEO continuously monitors the end-users received Quality of Service (QoS) and takes measures in case of violations.
